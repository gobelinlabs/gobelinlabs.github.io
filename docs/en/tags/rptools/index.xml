      <description>Context#As I&amp;rsquo;m diving into the investigation of battlemaps and their use-cases, the previous question being as simple as &amp;ldquo;Why do you use battlemaps?&amp;quot;, I was really interested in the fact that because they allow visual immersion was the most popular answer.
As a completely unexpected move, I thus started a new poll asking &amp;ldquo;What makes a map immersive?&amp;quot; (didn&amp;rsquo;t see that coming, heh?), hoping to get a better grasp on how DMs and players come to feel immersed from digitally painted maps.</description>

      <description>Context#I&amp;rsquo;ve been GM for almost 20 years now (ouch! ðŸŽ…) but I only recently came to VTT softwares, just like lots of other GM did when COVID-19 forced us home. I became quite an enthusiast, but as I&amp;rsquo;m a curious person, I wanted to get a better understanding of VTTs as both a social and a technical object.
Several questions came in mind, and the first was : Why do you use battlemaps?</description>
