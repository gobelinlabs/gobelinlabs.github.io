      <description>Context#I&amp;rsquo;ve been GM for almost 20 years now (ouch! ðŸŽ…) but I only recently came to VTT softwares, just like lots of other GM did when COVID-19 forced us home. I became quite an enthusiast, but as I&amp;rsquo;m a curious person, I wanted to get a better understanding of VTTs as both a social and a technical object.
Several questions came in mind, and the first was : Why do you use battlemaps?</description>
