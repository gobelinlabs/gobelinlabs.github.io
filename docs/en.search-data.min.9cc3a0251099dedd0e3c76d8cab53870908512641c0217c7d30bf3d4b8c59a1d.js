Mearly everyone-else chose an option related to scenography and structure !  The main discussions in comments were related to interactivity and relevance.\nThinking about it, both can be considered regarding structure and / or details:\n Interactivity of architecture/terrain/space which allows tactical moves and more interesting usage of the map, Interactivity of details (barrels, boxes, torches, shadow areas, etc.) which may give tactical advantages if used with guile, Relevance of the architecture/terrain/structure according to basic knowledge of physics (the way walls fall down, the way buildings collapse) to give a sense of belivability (‚ñ∫ an interesting comment about that on a battlemap thread), Relevance of details (objects, furniture, weather) when compared to the layout and the ambience to give a believable scenography (consistency in the wealth of furnitures in a scene as an example).  More is to come!\n\r\r Poll and data\r#\r\r Don\u0026rsquo;t worry I\u0026rsquo;ve knocked down the Math Gobelin\u0026hellip;\n Here are the 6 options for the poll:\n Graphic realism / Art Direction Details (number and/or consistency) Realism in structure / architecture / physics Mood scenography (lights and colours) Structural scenography (the way things are put together on the scene) Else  And here is a simple ASCII graph representing the 199 answers (numbers on the left, 1 decimal round-up percentage on the right):\n1. Graphic realism [25] ###### [12.6%]\r2. Details (nb./consistency) [36] ######### [18.1%]\r3. Realistic structure [40] ########## [20.1%]\r4. Mood scenography [35] ######### [17.6%]\r5. Structural scenography [57] ############## [28.6%]\r6. Else [ 6] ## [3%]\rGrouping into fewer categories in not as easy as in the previous poll because of the nuances implied by the phrasing:\n I tried to be as discriminatory as possible by specifying \u0026ldquo;Graphic realism\u0026rdquo;: the idea was to merge every idea of aesthetical realism in that one choice and no other, Every other option is thus implied as \u0026ldquo;not based on graphic realism\u0026rdquo; and may thus be considered per se.  This way, if Details (nb./consistency) was meaningful to some people, it would strictly be about them as items/entities, not about how they are depicted. The same consideration applies to Realism in structure / architecture / physics which was all about how terrain and architectures interact. Mood scenography could thus be considered only through the use of colours, shadows and lights, while Structural scenography was all about the stage.\nIn a way, all four of them could be merged into a large Staging category but, as I said, it\u0026rsquo;s tricky: one could consider a Scenography category grouping Mood and Layout (structural scenography), but then Details could get in too. Another approach would be to go for a Structure category, thus merging Realism in structure and Structural scenography, but one could argue that Details could fit in too.\nActually, Details could fit in every category as it adapts to the context (details of the structure, details in lights and shadows, details in staged objects, etc.).\nSo we end up having either a huge Staging category or no category at all, which is probably the best way to go in the end.\nHowever, we can partly guess how these options interact:\n Graphic realism isn\u0026rsquo;t that meaningful: as it came out, people didn\u0026rsquo;t vote that much for it. Details, Structure realism and Mood are about as important as one another: there is kind of a levelling here between those three options which collected about the same amount of votes Structural scenography is on top but not that far away, especially when compared to how Visual immersion won the battle for the previous poll.  Discussion\r#\r\rThe poll didn\u0026rsquo;t get as much comments as the previous one and my attempts to start a discussion on some of them was not as fruitful as before. However, some considerations are worth diving in.\nVisual and tactical interactions with the map\r#\r\rWhat interested me the most was this notion of Interaction. It was sadly too briefly mentionned in comments, but you may feel the notion of interaction inside the poll\u0026rsquo;s options, either from a graphical or from a tactical point of view.\nHere, Interactions could be defined as:\n Visual hooks, possibly unconscious hooks, that get your attention onto the map and invite you to \u0026ldquo;enter its world\u0026rdquo;, Interesting structures that you can play with (such as hiding places or heights that give you a good sight for a shot), Specific objects or details that call for actions (such as glowy buttons for a sci-fi map, or rusty levers in a fantasy one).  Interaction is action, and any form of action from the player is an engagement. And as we know, action leads to engagement, suggesting that \u0026ldquo;interesting battlemaps\u0026rdquo; could be those which inspire you to act upon the informations you get directly from them, to play with what they depict, whatever the stylization as long as they are well designed.\nRelevance, consistency, believability\r#\r\rThat\u0026rsquo;s probably the other side of the coin: getting players to interact is certainly great but what do you do if they ever spot an inconsistent detail on the map you used?\n GM: You enter the lord\u0026rsquo;s room and behold a fancy bed, with fancy sheets and golden candelabrums all over the place.\nThe map: \u0026lt; shows all of that but in a room that would clearly be a better fit for a guard\u0026rsquo;s bedroom \u0026gt;\n You could argue that \u0026ldquo;stuff happens\u0026rdquo; and you would definitely be right: maybe that lord has lost his castle and only managed to salvage those few items before taking refuge in an old, half-ruined fortified farm. \u0026ldquo;But how did he handled the massive canopy bed then???\u0026quot; \u0026hellip;\nYou would have to find quite a narrative for that (even if anything is possible: magic is a thing, after all)! And that\u0026rsquo;s not even the hardest situation: did you ever wonder \u0026ldquo;What the heck is this thing doing here??\u0026quot; when looking at a map?\nSometimes, it can be fun (like a small funky detail that was put here just for fun while still being relevant), but what if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a latrine spot at a 4 feet distance of a bed? A drawbridge drawn on top of a road? A bear-pelt capret asset that was in fact a dead bear token with a few drops of blood here and there, nicely sitting in the lord\u0026rsquo;s chamber? Huh\u0026hellip;\nOr it could be as simple as a lit torch hanged on a wall in the middle of the day! üòÇ\nTaking into consideration comments from other reddit posts such as the one I linked to before, I think it\u0026rsquo;s fairly reasonable to say that believability is key.\nNot necessarly realism. Believability. And in order to get a believable scene, you woul\u0026rsquo;d logically need objects that are relevant to the scene.\n  So here is an interesting subject!\nI hope you found it interesting, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to share or comment on the reddit thread to give your opinion on the subject üôÉ\nAlso, feel free to join the discussion, in our discord server!\n  üí¨ Reddit comments synthesis üí¨\rLayout  It\u0026rsquo;s about the layout: how details cover the map, how space allows tactical moves (sneaking, flanking), but also pertinence of the layout (placing objects where they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be)  Aesthetics \u0026amp; details  The map needs to look aesthetically pleasant above all: terrain, weather, seasons\u0026hellip; High details, shading and lighning Margin embellishment (dragons and leviathans drawn on the sides)  Interactivity and relevance  Interactivity of the map Relevant details: those that suck your attention in, without you noticing it  \r\r"}),a.add({id:3,href:'/en/posts/why_using_battlemaps/',title:"Why using battlemaps?",section:"üìù Blog",content:"    Context\r#\r\rI\u0026rsquo;ve been GM for almost 20 years now (ouch! üéÖ) but I only recently came to VTT softwares, just like lots of other GM did when COVID-19 forced us home. I became quite an enthusiast, but as I\u0026rsquo;m a curious person, I wanted to get a better understanding of VTTs as both a social and a technical object.\nSeveral questions came in mind, and the first was : Why do you use battlemaps??\nI started a poll thread on Reddit in order to ask the communities.\nYou can skim through the thread and coments right here ;-)\n\rDisclaimer: This post tends to use sophisticated terms, please don\u0026rsquo;t be mad at our Scrib Gobelin: sometimes he forgets he\u0026rsquo;s not a scientist!\r\r Lazy ‚áí gobelin\u0026#39;s ‚áí bait (quick-read)\rShort synthesis 183 voting people seem to like using battlemaps for two main reasons:\n Better immersion (41.5 %) Practicality (36 %)  Then we\u0026rsquo;ve got \u0026ldquo;aesthetics\u0026rdquo; properly speaking (a better look, 13 %) and \u0026ldquo;else\u0026rdquo; (9.5 %).\nReasons for using battlemaps are diverse. An important part of people is using them primarly for visual immersion and/or for practicality:\n Visual immersion seems to be more and more a thing in the community since artworks and graphics have become a tremendous part of our society, especially in video games and cinema. Practicality is always a winner and both GMs and players mentionned it as a significant input from battlemaps.  Two use-cases stand out:\n Using battlemaps as starting or improv point in order to focus creative energy on something else than creating an interesting and consistent topography Using details as narratives to enhance immersion and interactivity with the battlemap.  More is to come!\n\r\r Poll and data\r#\r\r Don\u0026rsquo;t worry I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the Math Gobelin quite\u0026hellip;\n Okay so here are the options used for the poll:\n It\u0026rsquo;s beautiful It\u0026rsquo;s handy compared to sketching or tiling assets on VTT softwares My players an I like the visual immersion I can use the visual details as narratives It\u0026rsquo;s better looking when I use tokens Something else  And here is a simple ASCII graph representing the 183 answers (numbers on the left, 1 decimal round-up percentage on the right):\n1. Beautiful [12] ##### [6.5 %]\r2. Handy [33] ############### [18 %]\r3. Visual immersion [76] ################################# [41.5 %]\r4. Details as narratives [33] ############# [18 %]\r5. Better with tokens [12] #### [6.5 %]\r6. Something else [17] ######## [9.3 %]\rI decided to group those items in three categories.\n Immersion, which refers to the map\u0026rsquo;s ability to create a meaningful vision of what it depicts, in which aesthetis may be involved but is not mandatory, Practicality, which refers to those aspects in a map which make the GM\u0026rsquo;s and player\u0026rsquo;s life easier, Aesthetics, which refers to the graphical qualities of the map, Else.  As Immersion was already cumulating half of the votes, it felt like it could be its own category. I was wondering if people would disregard the Beautiful and Better looking items in favour of Immersion but they did not: instead, some people explicitely voted for them rather than Immersion, which lead me to consider the nuance between graphical qualities and ability to create immersion. This observation lead me to merge these two items into the Aesthetics category.\nBeside those concepts, Handy compared to sketching on computer and Ability to use details as narratives were directly refering to Practicality as they were refering to interaction enhancements that affect the quality of the experience.\nFinally, Else was useful to help people formulating unlisted concepts such as Useful to measure or When system demands it. It was also used to say All of those choices! several times. I decided to keep these votes apart because there is no way to quantify how many people rally to a specific comment which could eventually be compared to one of the previous categories. Plus, the sum of the comments may not be related to the points collected under the item Something else.\nDiscussion\r#\r\r    Aesthetics versus Immersion\r#\r\rIt\u0026rsquo;s really interesting to see how aesthetics is part of the reasons why people use graphical battlemaps, while it really isn\u0026rsquo;t the only one, neither the primary one! Well, aesthetics is undoubtfuly connected to immersion as it eases the player and the GM into the scene through graphical qualities. I have no doubts you\u0026rsquo;ll agreee that a bad-looking map with obvious patterns and ugly pixels WILL hold back immersion (hold back, not prevent, let\u0026rsquo;s give the GM some credits!) while a good-looking map will help if used correctly (help, not ensure: again, let\u0026rsquo;s give the GM some credits ^^!)\nBut for some reasons people still made the difference between Beautiful or Good-looking and Immersive. This leads me to wonder which graphical and non-graphical qualities allow the map to be Immersive, and that\u0026rsquo;s probably the question for the next poll!\nMaps as starting or improv point\r#\r\rMaps are also used as a starting point for creation in order to avoid huge expenses of creative energy for those who are more comfortable working on the narrative arcs rather than the geography or topography of a scene (which is a skill set of its own in the end). This way, the GM may scroll for inspiration in his gallery and pinpoint a few worthy locations, then imagine a background plot and a way to fit those locations into the scenario.\nSome creators like Neutral Party are even kind enough to sort them by category, which allows a first level of filtering \u0026ndash; or you can organize them in a way that\u0026rsquo;s meaningful to you üôÇ\nSameway but different application: they can be used as improv points to generate a quick topography illustrating a situation. That\u0026rsquo;s a good way to compensate some player\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;unprompted strategy\u0026rdquo;:\n GM: You carefully walk through this frightening forest, avoiding several bandit camps in the hope they don\u0026rsquo;t see you\u0026hellip;\nPlayers: Wait! What if we raid them instead?!\nGM: Huh\u0026hellip;\n Using details as narratives\r#\r\rIn the mean time, I was really amazed to see how much people voted for I can use the visual details as narratives \u0026ndash; about 17 % ! I have to admit I really didn\u0026rsquo;t know where this was going: I always wondered if other GMs would try to give an actual existence to every details depicted on the map into the game, meaning the players may play knowing that Everything that\u0026rsquo;s on the map is also in the scene.\nFor a long time, I was quite sceptical with this : should I consider the map as a generic representation of the actual scene, meaning details are not to be taken in a litteral way and that the map is here only to enhance visual immersion? Or should I consider that every tiny little bit of details should be considered as is and as part of the actual scene in which the characters are living?\nLet me explain quickly why this question troubled me:\n If the map is partially abstracted, then it\u0026rsquo;s only decorative. Players appreciate the visuals but can\u0026rsquo;t rely on them so this means lots of questions like \u0026ldquo;what do I see actually?\u0026rdquo; ‚ñ∫ There is a feeling of dissonance between what they see and what their character sees and it kinda holds back the immersion: the map may feel like a pretty but meaningless stuff, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want meaningless stuff ruining our game experience. If the map is litteral, then every tiny detail can be used not only by me, but also by my players ‚ñ∫ they can spot details I didn\u0026rsquo;t see neither anticipated and use them to bring a solution to the scene. This situation do demands flexibility! It\u0026rsquo;s a binary situation: you can\u0026rsquo;t make compromises as the players have to know if they can rely on the details or not.  Relying on depicted details as narratives can be a thrilling thing but it thoroughly depends on both map\u0026rsquo;s definition and quality. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got details but a poor resoltion, you\u0026rsquo;re stuck with a bunch of pixels \u0026ndash; good luck to come up with great narratives from there ! On the other hand, if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a nice high-res map, you\u0026rsquo;re able to zoom in at a really satisfying and immersive level, but your loading time is gonna be a pain if everyone doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a good (I mean sometimes a really good) internet connexion. Plus, resolution doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean details: you still have to find qualitative maps that do convey a story through a subtle and fine composition and\u0026hellip; well, that\u0026rsquo;s quite a rare golden fish!\nSo in the end, seeing this item getting votes was really interesting. There definitely is a discussion to dive in here!\n  But let\u0026rsquo;s leave that for another post: here comes the end of this one with a quick synthesis of Reddit comments (just below in an expandable section üôÉ).\nThanks a lot for your interest in this reading, I hope you found something interesting for you.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to share \u0026mdash; spread the words, Gobelins!! ‚öîÔ∏è\nOr if you feel like continuing this discussion, join our discord server!\n  üí¨ Reddit comments synthesis üí¨\r\u0026ldquo;Someting else\u0026rdquo; and other comments  All of the options Immersive artworks for battlemaps convert playing use-cases from pen \u0026amp; paper to screen \u0026amp; computer (some did craft a tv/table for this purpose) Ability to measure Economy of creative energy to focus more on interpretation Necessity When the system demands it Usefull when improvizing an encounter in a generic / not story-related place Only for wargame/tactical phases of the game  Down-sides  Lots of maps on the internet show little understading of practical needs of GMs Lots of maps on the internet have unconsistent grids Even with a huuuuuuuuuuge gallery, you still can be one map short to fit your scenario!
