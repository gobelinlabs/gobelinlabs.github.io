## About

### Creation & contact

{{<hint info>}}
**Gobelin Labs** was created in late 2020 as a journal of relexions, discussions and works, both personnal and team-work.

Depending on the page's subject, content is either:

* **Original creation** (home-brew RPG rules, macros, illustrations, comics' strips, etc.)
* **Personal thoughts and propositions created over an existing content** (system tweaking, etc.)
* **Curation of existing content** (reviews, catalogs, etc.)

Whenever an existing content is used, a link is inserted redirecting to the original content if available and if not forgotten.
If you think a page should link to an external content, don't hesitate to ring the bell either through [GitHub](https://github.com/gobelinlabs) or via [twitter](https://twitter.com/EtienneSafa).
